# OSI 7-Layer Networking Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computer system. It includes 7 layers which is divided into two layers including Media Layers and Host Layers.

### Physical Layer

Let's imagine, we have two laptops and we want to connect them together. Since both laptops have network interface card, they can be connected using the network cable. We will use the copper network cable to create **point-to-point electrical shared medium** between these two devices. Physical medium can be copper, Fiber or WiFi.

Physical Layer specification define the transmission and reception of raw bit streams between a device and a shared physical medium. Specification means that both laptops have shared understanding of the physical medium.

If a device is referred as layer X, it means the device has functionality for layer X and below

If there is a more than two devices, it is not possible to connect them using the network cable, instead we can add a device called a **HUB.** The HUB job is to transmit anything received on any port, to every other port including any errors & collisions.

Cuople of points should be considered about physical layer:

-   There is no individual address, and all the data is processed by all devices.

-   If multiple devices transmit at once - a collision occurs

-   It has no media access control and no collision detection

### Data Link Layer

It runs over the physical layer. There are different data link layer protocol & standards for the different situation. It defines the a new concept called **frame.**

Frames are a format for sending information over a layer 2 network. Layer 2 also introduces a unique hardware address, called **MAC** address e.g. `3e:22:fb:b9:5b:75` for every device in the network. The MAC address is *hexadecimal* address, and it is 48 bits long. THe MAC address is not software assigned, in other word, the address is uniquely attached to a specific piece of hardware.

The MAC address is formed of two parts:

-   OUI which is the organizationally unique identifier and this assigned to companies who manufacture network devices.

-   NIC (Network interface controller)

Combining these two parts together causing the MAC address be globally unique.

The frame is the thing that layer two uses for communication is a container of sorts, and has a few different components:

-   **The Preamble & start frame delimiter.** It allows the devices to know that it's the start of the frame, so they can identify the various parts of that frame.

-   **The destination and the source MAC addresses.**

-   **EtherType** which is commonly used to specify which *layer three protocol* is putting its data inside a frame

-   **Payload** which is anywhere from 46 to 1500 bites in size for standard frames. It contains the data that the frame is sending. The data is generally provided by the layer three protocol and the protocol which is used

-   **Frame check sequence** which is used to identify any errors in the frame.

Encapsulation is the process of taking some data, and wrapping it inside the frame.

Still **Hub** can cause collision when both computers try to send the message. To avoid this collision, we can use **Switch**. Switch is a layer 2 device. It works the same way physically as hub, but it understand layer 2 so provides significant advantages.

Switch understand frames and MAC addresses. They maintain a MAC address table which starts off empty. As the switch receives frames on its port, it learn which devices are connected and populates the MAC address table.

If a frame is transmitted to specific MAC address, it will be forwarded to the specific port if the destination MAC address is in the table. If not, it will be forwarded to all the ports. Any frames with All f's will always be forwarded to all ports.

Switches store and forward. They do not repeat blindly like hubs. It means that only valid frames are forwarded. Collisions are isolated on the port they occurred. Every X port switch has X collision domains meaning every port on a switch creates its own collision domain, allowing multiple simultaneous transmissions without collisions.

### Network Layer

Newtwork layer is the common protocol, which can spam multiple different layer 2 (data link layer) networks. This layer can be added onto one or more layer 2 networks and it adds a few capabilities. It adds the **internet protocol or IP** which is across networking addresses, and can be assigned to devices. This can be used to communicate across networks using routing.

::: callout-tip
Devices called routers, which are layer 3 devices, move packets of data across different networks. They encapsulate a packet inside of an ethernet frame for that part of the journey over that local network.
:::

Packet is the data unit used within the internet protocol which is layer 3 protocol. Packets in many ways are similar to frames. They contain some data to be moved and they have the source and destination address.

The difference is that with frames, both the source and destination are generally local. With an IP pocket, the destination and source addresses could be on opposite sides of the planet. During their journey from source to destination, packets remain the same. As they move across layer 2 networks, they are placed inside frames which is known as encapsulation.

Two version of the internet protocol in use:

-   version four which has been used for decades.

-   version six which adds more scalability
