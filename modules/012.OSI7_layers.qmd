# OSI 7-Layer Networking Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computer system. It includes 7 layers which is divided into two layers including Media Layers and Host Layers.

### Physical Layer

Let's imagine, we have two laptops and we want to connect them together. Since both laptops have network interface card, they can be connected using the network cable. We will use the copper network cable to create **point-to-point electrical shared medium** between these two devices. Physical medium can be copper, Fiber or WiFi.

Physical Layer specification define the transmission and reception of raw bit streams between a device and a shared physical medium. Specification means that both laptops have shared understanding of the physical medium.

If a device is referred as layer X, it means the device has functionality for layer X and below

If there is a more than two devices, it is not possible to connect them using the network cable, instead we can add a device called a **HUB.** The HUB job is to transmit anything received on any port, to every other port including any errors & collisions.

Cuople of points should be considered about physical layer:

-   There is no individual address, and all the data is processed by all devices.

-   If multiple devices transmit at once - a collision occurs

-   It has no media access control and no collision detection

### Data Link Layer

It runs over the physical layer. There are different data link layer protocol & standards for the different situation. It defines the a new concept called **frame.**

Frames are a format for sending information over a layer 2 network. Layer 2 also introduces a unique hardware address, called **MAC** address e.g. `3e:22:fb:b9:5b:75` for every device in the network. The MAC address is *hexadecimal* address, and it is 48 bits long. THe MAC address is not software assigned, in other word, the address is uniquely attached to a specific piece of hardware.

The MAC address is formed of two parts:

-   OUI which is the organizationally unique identifier and this assigned to companies who manufacture network devices.

-   NIC (Network interface controller)

Combining these two parts together causing the MAC address be globally unique.

The frame is the thing that layer two uses for communication is a container of sorts, and has a few different components:

-   **The Preamble & start frame delimiter.** It allows the devices to know that it's the start of the frame, so they can identify the various parts of that frame.

-   **The destination and the source MAC addresses.**

-   **EtherType** which is commonly used to specify which *layer three protocol* is putting its data inside a frame

-   **Payload** which is anywhere from 46 to 1500 bites in size for standard frames. It contains the data that the frame is sending. The data is generally provided by the layer three protocol and the protocol which is used

-   **Frame check sequence** which is used to identify any errors in the frame.

Encapsulation is the process of taking some data, and wrapping it inside the frame.
:::

Still **Hub** can cause collision when both computers try to send the message. To avoid this collision, we can use **Switch**. Switch is a layer 2 device. It works the same way physically as hub, but it understand layer 2 so provides significant advantages.

Switch understand frames and MAC addresses. They maintain a MAC address table which starts off empty. As the switch receives frames on its port, it learn which devices are connected and populates the MAC address table.

If a frame is transmitted to specific MAC address, it will be forwarded to the specific port if the destination MAC address is in the table. If not, it will be forwarded to all the ports. Any frames with All f's will always be forwarded to all ports.

Switches store and forward. They do not repeat blindly like hubs. It means that only valid frames are forwarded. Collisions are isolated on the port they occurred. Every X port switch has X collision domains meaning every port on a switch creates its own collision domain, allowing multiple simultaneous transmissions without collisions.

### Network Layer

Newtwork layer is the common protocol, which can spam multiple different layer 2 (data link layer) networks. This layer can be added onto one or more layer 2 networks and it adds a few capabilities. It adds the **internet protocol or IP** which is across networking addresses, and can be assigned to devices. This can be used to communicate across networks using routing.

::: callout-tip
Devices called routers, which are layer 3 devices, move packets of data across different networks. They encapsulate a packet inside of an ethernet frame for that part of the journey over that local network.
:::

Packet is the data unit used within the internet protocol which is layer 3 protocol. Packets in many ways are similar to frames. They contain some data to be moved and they have the source and destination address.

The difference is that with frames, both the source and destination are generally local. With an IP pocket, the destination and source addresses could be on opposite sides of the planet. During their journey from source to destination, packets remain the same. As they move across layer 2 networks, they are placed inside frames which is known as encapsulation.

Two version of the internet protocol in use:

-   version four which has been used for decades.

-   version six which adds more scalability

**IP Addressing**

IP addressing is what identifies a device which uses layer 3 IP networking e.g. `133.33.3.7` . If you have a valid IP version 4 address, you can send packet to `133.33.3.7` . This format is known as **Dotted Decimal Notion** (4 x 0-255). All IP addresses are actually formed of two different parts:

-   There is a **network part** which states which IP network this IP address belongs to

-   THe **host part** which represents hosts on the network

::: callout-note
In this IP example: `133.33.3.7` , the network is `133.33` and the hosts on the network can use the remaining parts of the IP. In this case `3.7` is a one device on that network
:::

If the network part of the IP address matches between two different IP addresses, then they are on the same IP network. If not, they are on the different IP networks. IP addresses are not actually dotted decimal. THat's how they are represented for humans. They are actually binary numbers. Each decimal part of the IP address is an **8-bit** binary number (4 sets of 8 bits (octets) for a total of 32 bits).

::: callout-important
This network has a `/16` prefix. 16 bits of the IP are the network, and the remaining bits are for hosts.
:::

On networks, IPs are wither statically assigned by human and this known as *static IP* or they are assigned automatically by machine (DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

**Subnet** masks are a critical part of IP networking. They are configured on layer 3 interfaces along with IP addresses. What's also configured on most network interfaces is a default **gateway.** The gateway is an IP address on the local network which packets are forwarded to, generally if the intended destination is not a local IP. Subnet masks are what allow an IP device to know if an IP address which is communicating with is on the same network or not, and that influences if the device needs to use a gateway it can communicate locally.

::: callout-tip
IP: `133.33.3.7` -\> `100000101` . `00100001` . `00000011` . `00000111`

Subnet Mask: `255.255.0.0/16` -\> `11111111` . `111111` . `00000000` . `00000000`

Network part: `100000101` . `00100001` . `00000000` . `00000000` -\> `133.33.0.0`
:::

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** is used generally when you have a layer 3 pocket, and you want to encapsulate it inside a frame, and then send that frame to a MAC address. Initially you do not know the MAC address so the protocol is required to determine the MAC address for a given IP address.

::: callout-warning
A normal network device such as your phone or laptop, it it received a pocket which was not destined for it, it would just drop that pocket. A router though, it is different. The router's job is to route pockets so it is just fine to handle a pocket which is address somewhere else.

What Layer 3 (Network) added to Layer 2?

-   IP Address (IPv4/v6) - Cross network addressing

-   APR - Find the MAC address for this IP or given IP address

-   Route - where to forward a pocket

-   Route Tables - Multiple routes

-   Router - moves pockets from SRC top DEST - Encapsulating in L2 on the way

-   Device \<=\> Device communication over the internet

::: callout-warning
What IP does not provide?

It provides no method of individual channels of communication. Layer 3 provides pockets, and pockets only have source IP and destination IP. So if we are a given two devices you can only have one stream of communications. so you cannot have different applications on those devices communicating at the same time.
:::

::: callout-caution
Pockets could be delivered out of order. Individuals pockets moves across the internet through intermediate networks, and depending on network conditions, there is no guarantee that those pockets will take the same route from source to destination. Becasue of different network conditions, it is possible they could arrive in a different order.

## **Transport & Session Layers**

Layer 4 build on top of the layer 3 (network layer), and it adds two new protocols:

-   TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): You would pick TCP, when you want reliability, error correction, and ordering of data. It is used for most of the important application lab protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol meaning that you need to set up a connection between two devices and once set up, it creates a bidirectional channel of communications.

-   UDP (Usrer Datagram Protocol): It is faster, because it dose not have the TCP overhead required for the reliable delivery of data. *This means that it is less reliable*.

Both of these run on top of IP, and both of them add a collection of features depending on which one of them is used.

TCP something called **segment**. A segment is just another container for data like packet and frame. TCP segment are encapsulated within IP pocket. Segments do not have source or destination IP addresses, because they use the IP packets for transit from source to destination. TCP segments add additional capabilities to IP packets including source and destination ports, sequence, acknowledgment etc.

Source and destination ports which gives the combined TCP/IP protocol the ability to have multiple streams of conversations at the same time between two devices.

The sequence number is incremented with each segment that's sent and it's unique. It can be used for error correction, if things need to be re-transmitted, and it can be used to ensure that when IP packets are received, and TCP segments are pulled out, they can be correctly ordered. The sequence number is a way of uniquely identifying a particular segment within a particular connection so the both sides can make observations about it

The acknowledgment field is the that one side can indicate that is received up to and including a certain sequence number. Every segment which is transmitted needs to be acknowledged.
